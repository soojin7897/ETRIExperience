8-August-2015: We are in the process of minor changes, beautification and cleanup - so if you download the docs now - it may be any one of more of the following:

1. Un-organized.
2. Needless contents.
3. Missing acks and references.
4. Incomplete flows.


Going Ahead:
We plan to update these documents, as and when the newer versions of Openstack gets released - beginning with KILO.
